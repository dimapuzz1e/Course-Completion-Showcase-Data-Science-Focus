# Course-Completion-Showcase-Data-Science-Focus

This is a repository to showcase my achievement in the courses I took/am taking for self-development on the Coursera, Udemy, EPAM Learning and other platforms. I have attempted to group the courses based on the data science Venn diagram shown below. Each course includes a description of the materials covered, completed assignments, and obtained certificates. I regularly update this repository with new courses and achievements. I hope this report helps you gain an understanding of my knowledge and skills in the field of data science.
